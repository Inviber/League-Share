# Overview
League Share is an application for the community to create, manage, and spectate leagues. 
Users can create a league, add teams and players, and track stats of their
choice. This is a public application that allows anyone to be the owner of a league.

On this page the user can see past match scores within the league, follow the league, or choose to be redirected back to the main page.
Now, if a match was schedule that day a user has the option to spectate the match.
When spectating a match, the user can see the stats of each player on each team, the scores, and able to actively chat with other users spectating.

Another feature, is that the manager/owner of the league can establish castors which manages these scores, stats, and give highlights within the chat
that the users can see.
